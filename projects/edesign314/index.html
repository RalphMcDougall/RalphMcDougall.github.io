<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Design (E) 314 is the first independent design module that EE students at Stellenbosch University take.
The focus is on implementing a small digital system with a given theme and performance targets that must be met.
The project culminates in a large report describing the design of the system.
As a similar topic could be used in future, a detailed design will not be provided here.
Please contact me personally if you would like more information.</p>

<p>In 2021 each student was tasked with designing and assembling a simple arcade game system with an 8x8 LED Dot Matrix screen.
The demo of my project can be seen by clicking on the image below.</p>

  </a>
</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>The whole system was powered by a 9V battery.
User input was available through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>five push-buttons: four directional buttons, and one middle button</li>
  <li>physically tilting the system away from its resting position (measured by an inertial measurement unit)</li>
  <li>a sliding input</li>
</ul>

<p>The system was able to run two games:</p>
<ul>
  <li>moving a ball through one of four mazes</li>
  <li>controlling a bat in a tennis/pong/breakout game</li>
</ul>

<p>At the heart of the system was a STM32F103RB development board.
A serial output line was available with debug information, and a test connector was available to allow for automated testing.</p>

<h2 id="significant-work">Significant Work</h2>
<p>The three largest sub-systems of the project are described below.</p>

<h4 id="output">Output</h4>
<p>The 8x8 screen was assembled by hand on a prototyping board.
Although 64 LEDs were used, only 16 GPIO pins were used, saving a significant number of microcontroller peripheral connections.
This was possible because screen updates were performed through row scanning with the full screen updating at 125Hz.
The screen was designed and constructed to allow for this level of control.
Each row and column was assigned a dedicated GPIO pin; the columns being controlled directly from the pin and the rows being controlled by a low-side switch controlling a load given by the eight LEDs in that row.</p>

<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
<p>Peripheral access was provided by the STM Hardware Abstraction Layer.
Inputs were passed to a state machine which implemented all of the required functionality.
Debugging and development were made easier by using pure functions for the state transitions.
Software-level screen updates were triggered by a 1ms interrupt with the handler copying a row from the screen buffer to the relevant GPIO pins controlling the screen.</p>
<h4 id="io-interface">IO Interface</h4>
<p>The system peripherals used a wide range of interfaces.
The screen used a custom row-scanning interface controlled by standard GPIO pins.
Serial debugging made use of UART and the IMU was controlled through I2C.
The slider input was read through an ADC.
Each component had its own voltage, and noise tolerances which needed to be calculated and compensated for if necessary.</p>

<h2 id="personal-experience">Personal Experience</h2>
<p>I became significantly more confident with hardware development through this project.
Due to my second-year being almost entirely online due to COVID-19, I felt I had missed many useful electronics and microcontroller practicals.
Within two weeks I felt confident in my soldering abilities and felt I had gained a new appreciation for the complexities of digital systems.</p>

<p>I was quite proud of the robust software that I implemented as it significantly reduced my development time after an initial development investment.
Given this, I wish I had spent more time testing my debouncing algorithm.
This was the only given requirement that my system did not meet the specification as some button bounce was still measured by the test-station.
I had attempted to implement a digital low-pass filter, but a simpler system would have sufficed and been easier to debug.</p>

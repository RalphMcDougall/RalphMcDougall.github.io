I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at <a href="https://www.ee.sun.ac.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellenbosch University</a> specialising in Robotics. I am expecting to graduate in December 2022.
I have project and internship experience ranging from designing low-noise, low-power embedded systems to developing high-level software managing work shifts in large industries. 
My current academic interests lie in Control Theory and Signal Processing.

I occasionally participate in competitions, in particular those of a Mathematical or Algorithmic nature. 
I gained a love for teaching through my experiences coaching high-school students for national and international olympiads.

In my free time I enjoy running, reading, playing piano, and learning useless trivia.

This site is still very much a Work-In-Progress.

I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at <a href="https://www.ee.sun.ac.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellenbosch University</a> specialising in Robotics. I am expecting to graduate in December 2022.
I enjoy testing the limits of my knowledge, typically through participating in competitions and olympiads.

This site is still very much a Work-In-Progress.

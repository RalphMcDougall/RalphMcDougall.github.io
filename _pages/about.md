I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at <a href="https://www.ee.sun.ac.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellenbosch University</a>, graduating in December 2022.
I have experience designing low-noise, low-power embedded systems as well as developing high-level software for a large-scale product. 
During my studies thus far I have built breadth across the whole spectrum of Electrical Engineering with projects ranging from power amplifiers to digital logic design to Java applications.
My current academic interests lie in Control Theory and Signal Processing.

I occasionally participate in competitions, in particular those of a Mathematical or Algorithmic nature. 
I gained a love for teaching through my experiences coaching high-school students for national and international olympiads.

In my free time I enjoy running, reading, playing piano, and ballroom dance.

This site is still very much a Work-In-Progress.

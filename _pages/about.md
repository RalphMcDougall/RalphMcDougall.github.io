I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at [Stellenbosch University](https://www.ee.sun.ac.za/), graduating in December 2022.
I have experience designing embedded systems as well as high-level software development for a large-scale product. 
My current academic interests lie in Control Theory and Signal Processing.

I occasionally participate in competitions, in particular those of a Mathematical or Algorithmic nature. 
I have experience coaching high-school students for Olympiads on a national scale.

In my free time I enjoy running, reading, and playing piano.

This site is still very much a Work-In-Progress.

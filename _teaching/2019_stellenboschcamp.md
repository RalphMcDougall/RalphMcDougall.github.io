I taught "Intermediate Algebra" to students between grade 8 and 10 (age 14-16 approx.).
Topics covered were: basic set theory, algebraic expressions and factorisation, polynomials, inequalities and functional equations.
I prepared four hour-long lectures on these topics. 

Further responsibilities included setting, and marking five tests.
Tests consisted of five questions to be completed in 2.5 hours with fully-written solutions.
There were approximately 30 students.

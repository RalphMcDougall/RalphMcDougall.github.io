I was tasked with facilitating group learning sessions for the first-year engineering students.
This involved two hours per week of in-person time with students throughout the semester.
The module covered integral calculus and introductory linear algebra.
I completed a short training course on peer-to-peer facilitation of learning before the semester started.

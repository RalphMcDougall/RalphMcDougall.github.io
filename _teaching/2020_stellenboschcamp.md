I taught "Advanced Algebra" to students between grade 10 and 12 (age 16-18 approx.).
Topics covered were: complex numbers, polynomials, functional equations, and recurrence relations.
I prepared four hour-long lectures on these topics. 
All lectures were pre-recorded and presented online due to the pandemic.

Further responsibilities included setting, and marking five tests.
Tests consisted of five questions to be completed in 2.5 hours with fully-written solutions.
There were approximately 30 students.

I"^<p>I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at <a href="https://www.ee.sun.ac.za/">Stellenbosch University</a>, graduating in December 2022.
I have experience designing embedded systems as well as high-level software development for a large-scale product. 
During my studies thus far I have built breadth across the whole spectrum of Electrical Engineering with projects ranging from power amplifiers to digital logic design to Java applications.
My current academic interests lie in Control Theory and Signal Processing.</p>

<p>I occasionally participate in competitions, in particular those of a Mathematical or Algorithmic nature. 
I have experience coaching high-school students for Olympiads on a national scale.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy running, reading, and playing piano.</p>

<p>This site is still very much a Work-In-Progress.</p>
